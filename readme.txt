Hi User,After you set a valid mobile number in the DEFAULT NUMBER,
starting from the next time yu open the app,the app starts sending your location(every 5 seconds) to
the default number every alternate time you open the app (NOTE:during this time the app seems to close itself once you tap on it 
just to make sure no one knows that you are sending locations to your friend). In between these turns you can choose to change 
the default number(NOTE:during this time the app opens itself when you tap on it and you can choose to change the default number
and this cycle continues from the next time you open the app.You can manually stop sending the locations by clicking on the STOP button
during this time). And finally, Be safe :)
